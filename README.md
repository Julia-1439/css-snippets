# css snippets

I created this to hopefully streamline the styling process for Odin projects by creating commonly created styles into generalized snippets. Whether or not this will be useful I will see. But at the very least, I learned some new things from looking at a model website -- structuring the header, different form stylings, & different link stylings -- and I styled some non-textual form controls! Including creating a custom checkbox ;)
